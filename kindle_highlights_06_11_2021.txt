Negotiate in their world. Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It’s about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea.

To get rich, you need leverage. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. But most of these, like labor and capital, people have to give to you. For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money, assets to manage, or machines.

For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money, assets to manage, or machines. So to get these things, you have to build credibility, and you have to do it under your own name as much as possible, which is risky. So, accountability is a double-edged thing. It allows you to take credit when things go well and to bear the brunt of the failure when things go badly.

For example, a good software engineer, just by writing the right little piece of code and creating the right little application, can literally create half a billion dollars’ worth of value for a company. But ten engineers working ten times as hard, just because they choose the wrong model, the wrong product, wrote it the wrong way, or put in the wrong viral loop, have basically wasted their time. Inputs don’t match outputs, especially for leveraged workers.

If you’re on the business end of this accusation, you need to realize that the other side might not be trying to pick your pocket; like my friend, they might just be overwhelmed by circumstance. The best response either way is to take a deep breath and restrain your desire to concede. Then say, “Okay, I apologize. Let’s stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfairly and we’ll fix it.”

The last use of the F-word is my favorite because it’s positive and constructive. It sets the stage for honest and empathetic negotiation.

So please stop me at any time if you feel I’m being unfair, and we’ll address it.”

One can appreciate the importance of glue by an analogy with carpentry. A chair can be made quite easily by making the parts - seat, legs, back etc. - and sticking them together in the right way. But this depends on an ability to make joints and wood glue. Lacking that ability, the only way to make a chair is to carve it in one piece out of a solid block of wood, a much harder task. This example demonstrates both the enormous power of modularisation and the importance of having the right glue. Now let us return to functional programming. We shall argue in the remainder of this paper that functional languages provide two new, very important kinds of glue. We shall give many examples of programs that can be modularised in new ways, and thereby greatly simplifed. This is the key to functional 3

When writing a modular program to solve a problem, one frst divides the problem into subproblems, then solves the sub-problems and combines the solutions. The ways in which one can divide up the original problem depend directly on the ways in which one can glue solutions together. Therefore, to increase ones ability to modularise a problem conceptually, one must provide new kinds of glue in the programming language. Complicated scope rules and provision for separate compilation only help with clerical details; they ofer no new conceptual tools for decomposing problems.

If you grew up when inflation was high, you invested less of your money in bonds later in life compared to those who grew up when inflation was low. If you happened to grow up when the stock market was strong, you invested more of your money in stocks later in life compared to those who grew up when stocks were weak.

They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts.

Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.

But when the tide inevitably turns you’re suddenly losing money on something you’re not interested in. It’s a double burden, and the path of least resistance is to move onto something else. If you’re passionate about the company to begin with—you love the mission, the product, the team, the science, whatever—the inevitable down times when you’re losing money or the company needs help are blunted by the fact that at least you feel like you’re part of something meaningful.

The analogous Gödelian leap with respect to computers would be to see that because computers at base manipulate numbers, and because numbers are a universal medium for the embedding of patterns of any sort, computers can deal with arbitrary patterns, whether they are logical or illogical, consistent or inconsistent. In short, when one steps back far enough from myriads of interrelated number patterns, one can make out patterns from other domains, just as the eye looking at a screen of pixels sees a familiar face and nary a 1 or 0. This Gödelian view of computers has exploded on the modern world to such an extent that today the numerical substrate of computers is all but invisible, except to specialists. Ordinary people routinely use computers for word processing, game playing, communication, animation, designing, drawing, and on and on, all without ever thinking about the basic arithmetical operations going on deep down in the hardware.

The traditional belief that the axioms of geometry (or, for that matter, the axioms of any discipline) can be established by their apparent self-evidence was thus radically undermined. Moreover, it gradually became clear that the proper business of pure mathematicians is to derive theorems from postulated assumptions, and that it is not their concern whether the axioms assumed are actually true. And, finally, these successful modifications of orthodox geometry stimulated the revision and completion of the axiomatic bases for many other mathematical systems.

In the 1950s, Oxford biologist John Gurdon was thinking about how certain animal cells seem to rejuvenate themselves. He wondered if cells already specialized—as skin or liver or other types of adult cells—might retain a latent ability to revert to their predifferentiated state. To test this hypothesis, he replaced the nucleus of a frog egg cell with one from a fully mature and specialized frog cell. After a series of these (literally) adulterated egg cells failed to do much of anything after being inseminated with frog sperm, a few, miraculously, became fertilized and healthy tadpoles were created. Gurdon proved that any adult cell, under the right circumstances, had the innate ability to go back in developmental time to become the equivalent of an embryonic stem cell.

In 2012, Japanese cell biologists Katsuhiko Hayashi and Mitinori Saitou announced they had used the Yamanaka factors to reprogram adult mouse skin cells in a dish into iPS cells. They then added more chemicals to turn these stem cells into egg and sperm progenitor cells, the precursors of eggs and sperm. After they placed the same artificial cells into mouse ovaries, the cells matured into eggs. When they put induced sperm precursor into mouse testes, these cells matured into sperm. These induced eggs and sperm were used for mouse IVF, resulting in perfectly healthy baby mice. Even though the success rate for these iPSC-generated sperm and eggs in IVF was extremely low, this was a spectacular breakthrough.

This is a hypothetical, so we can experiment with who we slot into this story in the role of your partner. It could be your husband, but also potentially anybody else. We could imagine a version where two men could have their own 100 percent biologically related babies, using the sperm of one father and eggs induced from an adult cell taken from the other father.

If we got in our time machine and went back eight thousand years to visit those first chicken-domesticating humans and asked them how many eggs a chicken might lay, they would have been hard-pressed to envision thirty a month. Thirty eggs a month would have sounded then as crazy as a woman today having thirty babies in nine months. The point here is that biology is significantly more susceptible to hacking than initially meets the eye.

But what if we could speed up that process to reduce the human generational turnover to about the same six months as a chicken—not by making babies mature faster but by breeding preimplanted embryos with each other? The idea sounds straight out of dystopian science fiction but could someday in the not-too-distant future be possible.

This cultural hubris, or overweening presumption about what we are entitled to from a universe that is basically insensitive to human needs, generally leads to trouble. The unwarranted sense of security sooner or later results in a rude awakening. When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity. As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned. Deprived of the customary supports that cultural values had given them, they flounder in a morass of anxiety and apathy.

philosopher Roger Scruton put it well in a recent book. ‘Originality,’ he said, ‘is not an attempt to capture attention come what may, or to shock or disturb in order to shut out competition from the world. The most original works of art may be genial applications of a well-known vocabulary…. What makes them original is not their defiance of the past or their rude assault on settled expectations, but the element of surprise with which they invest the forms and repertoire of a tradition. Without tradition, originality cannot exist: for it is only against a tradition that it becomes perceivable.’

These two founded the ‘Psychological Wednesday Society,’ which met every Wednesday evening in Freud’s waiting room under the silent stare of his ‘grubby old gods,’ a reference to the archaeological objects he collected.23 They were joined in 1902 by Alfred Adler, by Paul Federn in 1904, by Eduard Hirschmann in 1905, by Otto Rank in 1906, and in 1907 by Carl Gustav Jung from Zurich. In that year the name of the group was changed to the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and thereafter its sessions were held in the College of Physicians.

The discovery of the ‘mother civilisation’ for European society added to this, reinforcing the view that religions evolved, too, meaning that one old way of understanding the world was subsumed under another, newer, more scientific approach. Such a change in the fundamentals was bound to be disturbing, but there was more to come.

It is important, however, not to fall into the mechanistic fallacy and expect that, just because a person is objectively involved in a flow activity, she will necessarily have the appropriate experience. It is not only the “real” challenges presented by the situation that count, but those that the person is aware of.

Other pleasures also activate the reward centre, but their associated nerve cells don’t overlap as completely with sex. Therefore non-sexual natural rewards feel different and less compelling.

Other things that used to make a porn viewer feel good, such as socializing, watching a movie or playing a favourite game, pale because of the dulling effects of CREB.

findings suggest that people might vary in the number of external cues they need to accomplish the same mental task. Individuals who require a great deal of outside information to form representations of reality in consciousness may become more dependent on the external environment for using their minds. They would have less control over their thoughts, which in turn would make it more difficult for them to enjoy experience. By contrast, people who need only a few external cues to represent events in consciousness are more autonomous from the environment. They have a more flexible attention that allows them to restructure experience more easily, and therefore to achieve optimal experiences more frequently.

In me, tolerification is toxic to intrinsic motivation. If you want intrinsic drive, I suggest you train yourself to notice when your gaze slips to one side or the other. When that happens, focus, and stare directly at the dark world.

Live there, in the face of the intolerable. Don't struggle to make it acceptable, just live with the bad world, while buckling down rather than buckling. It is there, while staring the dark world in the face, that I find a deep well of intrinsic drive.

Imagine you're a new homunculus that has just landed in a branch of the multiverse where things were going poorly—maybe you recently lost social status, or made a choice that had worse effects than you expected, just before the new homunculus teleported in. This is an uncomfortable place to find yourself in! What do you do next? Would you immediately throw a fit? What's the point of that? You just teleported into this part of the multiverse; how is struggling against the past supposed to help you?

If you're already walking the path you want to walk, if you're working on becoming kinder, or more generous, or psychologically stronger, or wealthier, or smarter, if you're already moving as fast as you can given your current constraints, then the fact that the world is still hurting and you aren't strong enough to fix things yet is no reason for guilt.

Effective responses aren't about answering quickly, either. When paired with expertise and familiarity an effective response to an obstacle will often lead to a fast answer, but oftentimes the most effective response is to pause and think. Plenty of people have very ineffective response patterns that involve opening their mouths the moment you ask them to help you confront an obstacle. Some people reflexively start solving the wrong problem, others reflexively start making excuses for themselves, still others reflexively share personal anecdotes that paint them in a positive light. Effective response patterns are not about answering fast, they're about answering well.

Response patterns like "verify that your observations were correct" or "find more data" or "generate more than one plausible explanation for the surprise" and so on.

In many different human societies—Australian Aborigines, Amish farmers, West Point cadets—the worst sanction the community can issue is shunning. The person ignored grows gradually depressed, and soon begins to doubt his or her very existence. In some societies the final outcome of being ostracized is death: the person who is left alone comes to accept the fact that he must be already dead, since no one pays attention to him any longer; little by little he stops taking care of his body, and eventually passes away. The Latin locution for “being alive” was inter hominem esse, which literally meant “to be among men”; whereas “to be dead” was inter hominem esse desinere, or “to cease to be among men.”

Social science surveys have universally concluded that people claim to be most happy with friends and family, or just in the company of others. When they are asked to list pleasant activities that improve their mood for the entire day, the kind of events most often mentioned are “Being with happy people,” “Having people show interest in what I say,” “Being with friends,” and “Being noticed as sexually attractive.”

If you want to become a successful entrepreneur, or if you want to succeed at other very difficult tasks, it helps to be able to take the best from both types of hopeless entrepreneurs. Become the sort of person who can enter the fugue state and give an idea your all, while also being able to see and avoid all the common failure modes. The fact that you are unlikely to succeed is an epistemic fact, you do not need to give it dominion over your motivation. Be a little reckless.

Recklessness, as a virtue, is about being able to throw caution to the wind. It's about being able to commit yourself fully to the best path before you, and then change your entire life at the drop of a pin as soon as a better path appears. It's about being free to act without worrying too much about what happens if you disrupt the status quo -- too many people are already too stagnant, and we need to move faster.

So we can now also see the domain dependence of our minds, a “domain” being an area or category of activity. Some people can understand an idea in one domain, say, medicine, and fail to recognize it in another, say, socioeconomic life. Or they get it in the classroom, but not in the more complicated texture of the street. Humans somehow fail to recognize situations outside the contexts in which they usually learn about them.

Which of these methods for transmitting property was adopted seems to have been due almost entirely to chance, yet the choice had profound economic implications. (Primogeniture led to concentration of capital in the lands that used this method, which in turn led to industrialization; whereas equal sharing led to the fragmentation of property and industrial underdevelopment.) More pertinent to our story, the relationship between siblings in a culture that had adopted primogeniture must have been substantially different from one in which equal economic benefits accrued to all children.

For such goals to result in interactions that will help increase the complexity of its members, the family must be both differentiated and integrated. Differentiation means that each person is encouraged to develop his or her unique traits, maximize personal skills, set individual goals. Integration, in contrast, guarantees that what happens to one person will affect all others. If a child is proud of what she accomplished in school, the rest of the family will pay attention and will be proud of her, too. If the mother is tired and depressed, the family will try to help and cheer her up. In an integrated family, each person’s goals matter to all others.

With time one gets to know the other person well, and the obvious challenges have been exhausted. All the usual gambits have been tried; the other person’s reactions have become predictable. Sexual play has lost its first excitement. At this point, the relationship is in danger of becoming a boring routine that might be kept alive by mutual convenience, but is unlikely to provide further enjoyment, or spark a new growth in complexity.

paper published in the journal Nature in 2003 by Gerard Karsenty and colleagues. The tradition has been to think that aging causes bone weakness (bones lose density, become more brittle), as if there was a one-way relationship possibly brought about by hormones (females start experiencing osteoporosis after menopause). It turns out, as shown by Karsenty and others who have since embarked on the line of research, that the reverse is also largely true: loss of bone density and degradation of the health of the bones also causes aging, diabetes, and, for males, loss of fertility and sexual function. We just cannot isolate any causal relationship in a complex system.

This is characteristic of how great people think. It’s not that they find failure in every success. They just hold themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success. Because of that, they don’t much care what other people think; they care whether they meet their own standards. And these standards are much, much higher than everyone else’s.

while hormesis corresponds to situations by which the individual organism benefits from direct harm to itself, evolution occurs when harm makes the individual organism perish and the benefits are transferred to others, the surviving ones, and future generations.

The engineer and historian of engineering Henry Petroski presents a very elegant point. Had the Titanic not had that famous accident, as fatal as it was, we would have kept building larger and larger ocean liners and the next disaster would have been even more tragic. So the people who perished were sacrificed for the greater good; they unarguably saved more lives than were lost. The story of the Titanic illustrates the difference between gains for the system and harm to some of its individual parts.

Good systems such as airlines are set up to have small errors, independent from each other—or, in effect, negatively correlated to each other, since mistakes lower the odds of future mistakes. This is one way to see how one environment can be antifragile (aviation) and the other fragile (modern economic life with “earth is flat” style interconnectedness).

Further, my characterization of a loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn’t introspect, doesn’t exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on.

Likewise, we humans may have to be self-centered at the expense of other species, at the risk of ecological fragility, if it insures our survival. Our interests—as a human race—prevail over those of nature; and we can tolerate some inefficiency, some fragility, in order to protect individuals, although sacrificing nature too much may eventually hurt ourselves.

That it’s admirable to want to be better businessmen or business-women, better athletes, better conquerors. We should want to be better informed, better off financially… We should want, as I’ve said a few times in this book, to do great things. I know that I do. But no less impressive an accomplishment: being better people, being happier people, being balanced people, being content people, being humble and selfless people. Or better yet, all of these traits together. And what is most obvious but most ignored is that perfecting the personal regularly leads to success as a professional, but rarely the other way around.

We will learn that though we think big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek. Because we will be action and education focused, and forgo validation and status, our ambition will not be grandiose but iterative—one foot in front of the other, learning and growing and putting in the time.

Doing great work is a struggle. It’s draining, it’s demoralizing, it’s frightening—not always, but it can feel that way when we’re deep in the middle of it. We talk to fill the void and the uncertainty. “Void,” Marlon Brando, a quiet actor if there ever was one, once said, “is terrifying to most people.” It is almost as if we are assaulted by silence or confronted by it, particularly if we’ve allowed our ego to lie to us over the years. Which is so damaging for one reason: the greatest work and art comes from wrestling with the void, facing it instead of scrambling to make it go away.

Several years ago, I was taking part in a radio show along with designer Michael Graves. I had just criticized one of Graves’s creations, the “Rooster” teapot, as being pretty to look at, but difficult to use—to pour the water was to risk a scalding—when a listener called in who owned the Rooster. “I love my teapot,” he said. “When I wake up in the morning and stumble across the kitchen to make my cup of tea, it always makes me smile.” His message seemed to be: “So what if it’s a little difficult to use? Just be careful. It’s so pretty it makes me smile, and first thing in the morning, that’s most important.”

Is passion a useful tool for success, or is it just something that makes you irrational? My hypothesis is that passionate people are more likely to take big risks in the pursuit of unlikely goals, and so you would expect to see more failures and more huge successes among the passionate. Passionate people who fail don’t get a chance to offer their advice to the rest of us. But successful passionate people are writing books and answering interview questions about their secrets for success every day.

when I invested in a restaurant with an operating partner, my passion was sky-high. And on day one, when there was a line of customers down the block, I was even more passionate. In later years, as the business got pummeled, my passion evolved into frustration and annoyance. The passion disappeared. On the other hand, Dilbert started out as just one of many get-rich schemes I was willing to try. When it started to look as if it might be a success, my passion for cartooning increased because I realized it could be my golden ticket. In hindsight, it looks as if the projects I was most passionate about were also the ones that worked. But objectively, my passion level moved with my success. Success caused passion more than passion caused success.

He said that every time he got a new job, he immediately started looking for a better one. For him, job seeking was not something one did when necessary. It was an ongoing process. This makes perfect sense if you do the math. Chances are the best job for you won’t become available at precisely the time you declare yourself ready. Your best bet, he explained, was to always be looking for the better deal. The better deal has its own schedule. I believe the way he explained it is that your job is not your job; your job is to find a better job.

One of the more interesting surprises for me when I started making more money than I would ever spend is that it automatically changed my priorities. I could afford any car I wanted, but suddenly I didn’t care so much about my possessions beyond the utility they provided. Once all of my personal needs were met, my thoughts automatically turned to how I could make the world a better place. I didn’t plan the transformation. It wasn’t something I thought about and decided to do. It just happened on its own. Apparently humans are wired to take care of their own needs first, then family, tribe, country, and the world, roughly in that order.

Managing your personal energy is like managing budgets in a company. In business, every financial decision in one department is connected to others. If the research and development group cuts spending today, eventually that decision will ripple through the organization and reduce profits in some future year. Similarly, when you manage your personal energy, it’s not enough to maximize it in the short run or in one defined area. Ideally, you want to manage your personal energy for the long term and the big picture. Having one more cocktail at midnight might be an energy boost at the time, but you pay for it double the next day.

We cognitive scientists now understand that emotion is a necessary part of life, affecting how you feel, how you behave, and how you think. Indeed, emotion makes you smart. That’s the lesson of my current research. Without emotions, your decision-making ability would be impaired. Emotion is always passing judgments, presenting you with immediate information about the world: here is potential danger, there is potential comfort; this is nice, that bad. One of the ways by which emotions work is through neurochemicals that bathe particular brain centers and modify perception, decision making, and behavior. These neurochemicals change the parameters of thought.

Not necessarily the same as human emotions, these will be emotions nonetheless, ones tailored to the needs and requirements of a robot.

We have long known that when people are anxious they tend to narrow their thought processes, concentrating upon aspects directly relevant to a problem. This is a useful strategy in escaping from danger, but not in thinking of imaginative new approaches to a problem. Isen’s results show that when people are relaxed and happy, their thought processes expand, becoming more creative, more imaginative.

Just as with the family, people believe that friendships happen naturally, and if they fail, there is nothing to be done about it but feel sorry for oneself. In adolescence, when so many interests are shared with others and one has great stretches of free time to invest in a relationship, making friends might seem like a spontaneous process. But later in life friendships rarely happen by chance: one must cultivate them as assiduously as one must cultivate a job or a family.

You might be thinking this is all well and good for famous authors and cartoonists, but ordinary people don’t have many chances to change the world. I disagree. Ideas change the world routinely, and most of those ideas originate from ordinary people. You might have a patent idea, a product idea, or a process idea that could change the world. Before my cartoon career, I had plenty of big ideas that didn’t work out. When one idea failed, I usually had two more to take its place. And every one of my ideas had real-world potential, even if the odds were bad.

I’ve come to believe that success at anything has a spillover effect on other things. You can take advantage of that effect by becoming good at things that require nothing but practice. Once you become good at a few unimportant things, such as hobbies or sports, the habit of success stays with you on more important quests. When you’ve tasted success, you want more. And the wanting gives you the sort of energy that is critical to success.

In the late nineties I spent some time in the Los Angeles area trying to get a Dilbert TV pilot off the ground. The first attempt, which failed miserably, involved live actors portraying the Dilbert characters. During that process I got to observe a test audience watching the pilot and registering their opinions in real time. Moving graphs appeared on monitors so we could see the ebb and flow of the audience’s enjoyment at each point in the show. I was chatting with the television executive in charge of the project and asking what the cutoff was for an acceptable test-audience response. The executive explained that for television shows, the best predictor is not the average response. Averages don’t mean much for entertainment products. What you’re looking for is an unusually strong reaction from a subset of the public, even if the majority hates it.

Once the creative stage is completed, the ideas that have been generated have to be transformed into real products. Now the design team must exert considerable attention to detail. Here, focus is essential. One way to do this is through deadlines just slightly shorter than feel comfortable. Here is the time for the concentrated focus that negative affect produces. This is one reason people often impose deadlines on themselves, and then announce those deadlines to others so as to make them real. Their anxiety helps them get the work done.

The same phenomenon occurs in almost all aspects of life, whether in interactions with people, in a sport, a book, or even a walk in the woods.

There is one other distinction among the levels: time. The visceral and behavioral levels are about “now,” your feelings and experiences while actually seeing or using the product. But the reflective level extends much longer—through reflection you remember the past and contemplate the future. Reflective design, therefore, is about long-term relations, about the feelings of satisfaction produced by owning, displaying, and using a product.

It’s fine to challenge your learners—this isn’t about making it easy for them. Things that are too easy aren’t a good way to learn either. But you don’t want to have your learners feel shame about what they do and don’t know. Instead, you want to give your learners a safe path into the material.

Some ways to engage wary learners: • Leverage what they already know. Can you take advantage of any knowledge they already have about the topic? • Give them some early success. What can be something they can achieve early on? Is there some accomplishment that they can tackle with the material within the first lesson? • Create safe places to fail. Can they practice or self-assess in a private or non-judgmental environment?

This means that all the things you built into the learner’s journey to support novices (careful guidance, lots of practice, slowly helping them build their mental model before adding in content) are pretty much guaranteed to make the expert absolutely nuts.

One of the most common tactics for addressing varying difficulty levels is to say “We’ll have a pre-test! So if people really know the information, they don’t have to take the course!” Here’s the thing with this. This is a perfectly reasonable approach IF you think you can create a genuinely effective pre-test that measures knowledge or skill. Honestly, I’ve not seen that many good pre-tests. Either they tend to be trivia questions, or they tend to be so easy that any reasonably astute person could guess their way through to a passing score. It’s hard to write a good assessment.

What if the topic is too complicated for novice learners to really tackle without hopelessly oversimplifying the content? What if putting the content into a realistic context means that context is overwhelming to the user? One of the ways to deal with this is scaffolding. Basically, you can build supports to make the incline less steep. Then you can gradually reduce those supports until learners can handle the incline on their own.

Lack of fear of embarrassment Education (the right kind) Exercise A lack of fear of embarrassment is what allows one to be proactive. It’s what makes a person take on challenges that others write off as too risky. It’s what makes you take the first step before you know what the second step is. I’m not a fan of physical risks, but if you can’t handle the risk of embarrassment, rejection, and failure, you need to learn how, and studies suggest that is indeed a learnable skill.1

When it comes to in-person humor, effort counts a lot. When people see you trying to be funny, it frees them to try it themselves. So even if your own efforts at humor fall short, you might be freeing the pent-up humor in others. People need permission to be funny in social or business settings because there’s always a risk that comes with humor.

Let’s take, for example, the question of how much sexual desire a person is supposed to have. How much is too little? When is too little unhealthy? How might one’s answers, or the answers that are assumed, change depending on gender, or race identity, or disability? What does the amount of desire we experience mean about our politics, our personalities, and our prospects for relationships? What should it mean?

Lucid’s story is easy for people to accept; mine, less so. Lucid’s sex repulsion—the eels, the nausea—seems very different from the experience of allos, so people think that’s what asexuality should be like. My experience, on the other hand, might sound typical for a less sexual person in a sexual society, not like anything out of the ordinary or anything that requires a separate identity label. Many allos may find my story familiar and prefer not to identify as asexual. So why do I identify as ace when I could identify as an allo woman who is not sexually motivated? First, it is because many parts of my experience—like the fact that I never think about sex involuntarily and could be celibate for life with little trouble—line up with the experiences of other aces. Learning about asexuality provoked a shock of recognition and I wanted to honor that. I have always been a stickler for using the word that fits, even when I didn’t like either the experience or the word.

Developmental psychologists have done extensive research on the effects of a student’s approach on his or her ability to learn and ultimately master material. Dr. Carol Dweck, a leading researcher in the field of developmental psychology, makes the distinction between entity and incremental theories of intelligence. Children who are “entity theorists”—that is, kids who have been influenced by their parents and teachers to think in this manner—are prone to use language like “I am smart at this” and to attribute their success or failure to an ingrained and unalterable level of ability. They see their overall intelligence or skill level at a certain discipline to be a fixed entity, a thing that cannot evolve. Incremental theorists, who have picked up a different modality of learning—let’s call them learning theorists—are more prone to describe their results with sentences like “I got it because I worked very hard at it” or “I should have tried harder.” A child with a learning theory of intelligence tends to sense that with hard work, difficult material can be grasped—step by step, incrementally, the novice can become the master.

I have used chess to illustrate this entity/incremental dynamic, but the issue is fundamental to the pursuit of excellence in all fields. If a young basketball player is taught that winning is the only thing that winners do, then he will crumble when he misses his first big shot. If a gymnast or ballet dancer is taught that her self-worth is entirely wrapped up in a perfectly skinny body that is always ready for performance, then how can she handle injuries or life after an inevitably short career? If a businessperson cultivates a perfectionist self-image, then how can she learn from her mistakes?

Chess was a constant challenge. My whole career, my father and I searched out opponents who were a little stronger than me, so even as I dominated the scholastic circuit, losing was part of my regular experience. I believe this was important for maintaining a healthy perspective on the game. While there was a lot of pressure on my shoulders, fear of failure didn’t move me so much as an intense passion for the game. I think the arc of losing a heartbreaker before winning my first big title gave me license to compete on the edge.

This brings up an incipient danger in what may appear to be an incremental approach. I have seen many people in diverse fields take some version of the process-first philosophy and transform it into an excuse for never putting themselves on the line or pretending not to care about results. They claim to be egoless, to care only about learning, but really this is an excuse to avoid confronting themselves. This issue of process vs. goal is very delicate, and I want to carefully define how I feel the question should be navigated.

internalize a process-first approach by making her everyday feedback respond to effort over results. She should praise good concentration, a good day’s work, a lesson learned. When he wins a tournament game, the spotlight should be on the road to that moment and beyond as opposed to the glory. On the other hand, it is okay for a child (or an adult for that matter) to enjoy a win.

A ticking chess clock can be a telltale heart, pounding like thunder in your mind. I was having terrible and hilarious noise problems, and then one day I had a breakthrough. I was playing a tournament in Philadelphia with a Phil Collins song rattling away in my brain when I realized that I could think to the beat of the song. My chess calculations began to move to the rhythm of the music, and I played an inspired game. After this moment, I took the bull by the horns and began training to have a more resilient concentration.

I find it useful to daydream that the future will be better than today, by far. I like to imagine a future that is spectacular and breathtaking.

If no longer craving your favorite food sounds like a sacrifice, it isn’t. That’s an illusion caused by the fact that it’s nearly impossible to imagine losing a craving of any kind. Cravings feel like they grow directly from our core. They feel a part of us. My experience is that cravings can be manipulated.

For a few months, eat as much as you want of anything that is not a simple carb. That frees up your willpower so you can use it to avoid those delicious and convenient simple carbs.

One idea I taught was the importance of regaining presence and clarity of mind after making a serious error. This is a hard lesson for all competitors and performers. The first mistake rarely proves disastrous, but the downward spiral of the second, third, and fourth error creates a devastating chain reaction. Any sports fan has seen professional football, basketball, and baseball games won and lost because of a shift in psychological advantage. People speak about momentum as if it were an entity of its own, an unpredictable player on the field, and from my own competitive experience, I can vouch for it seeming that way. The key is to bring that player onto your team by riding the psychological wave when it is behind you, and snapping back into a fresh presence when your clarity of mind begins to be swept away.

Chess players are constantly calculating variations and either accepting or dismissing them based on a comparison of how they evaluate the visualized position vs. the original position. So if you have an advantage, make an error, and then still cling to the notion that you have an advantage, then when you calculate a variation that looks equal, you will reject that line of thought because you incorrectly believe it is moving you in the wrong direction.

The simplest possible transport protocol is one that extends the host-to-host delivery service of the underlying network into a process-to-process communication service. There are likely to be many processes running on any given host, so the protocol needs to add a level of demultiplexing, thereby allowing multiple application processes on each host to share the network. Aside from this requirement, the transport protocol adds no other functionality to the best-effort service provided by the underlying network. The Internet's User Datagram Protocol is an example of such a transport protocol.

Congestion control involves preventing too much data from being injected into the network, thereby causing switches or links to become overloaded. Thus, flow control is an end-to-end issue, while congestion control is concerned with how hosts and networks interact.

Many technologies can be used to build "last-mile" links or to connect a modest number of nodes together, but how do we build networks of global scale? A single Ethernet can interconnect no more than 1024 hosts; a point-to-point link connects only two. Wireless networks are limited by the ranges of their radios. To build a global network, we need a way to interconnect these different types of links and networks. The concept of interconnecting different types of networks to build a large, global network is the core idea of the Internet and is often referred to as internetworking.

I believe that one of the most critical factors in the transition to becoming a conscious high performer is the degree to which your relationship to your pursuit stays in harmony with your unique disposition. There will inevitably be times when we need to try new ideas, release our current knowledge to take in new information—but it is critical to integrate this new information in a manner that does not violate who we are. By taking away our natural voice, we leave ourselves without a center of gravity to balance us as we navigate the countless obstacles along our way.

In certain competitive arenas—our working lives, for example—there are seldom weeks in which performance does not matter. Similarly, it is not so difficult to have a beginner’s mind and to be willing to invest in loss when you are truly a beginner, but it is much harder to maintain that humility and openness to learning when people are watching and expecting you to perform. True enough. This was a huge problem for me in my chess career after the movie came out. Psychologically, I didn’t give myself the room to invest in loss.

In the chapter The Soft Zone, I mentioned that there are three critical steps in a resilient performer’s evolving relationship to chaotic situations. First, we have to learn to be at peace with imperfection. I mentioned the image of a blade of grass bending to hurricane-force winds in contrast to a brittle twig snapping under pressure. Next, in our performance training, we learn to use that imperfection to our advantage—for example thinking to the beat of the music or using a shaking world as a catalyst for insight. The third step of this process, as it pertains to performance psychology, is to learn to create ripples in our consciousness, little jolts to spur us along, so we are constantly inspired whether or not external conditions are inspiring.

A soccer player who favors his right leg should not take a right-footed shot for an extended period of time. If dirty opponents inspire a great competitor to raise his game, he should learn to raise his game without relying on the ugly ruses of his opponents (see Making Sandals, in Part III). Once we learn how to use adversity to our advantage, we can manufacture the helpful growth opportunity without actual danger or injury. I call this tool the internal solution—we can notice external events that trigger helpful growth or performance opportunities, and then internalize the effects of those events without their actually happening. In this way, adversity becomes a tremendous source of creative inspiration.

In my opinion, intuition is our most valuable compass in this world. It is the bridge between the unconscious and the conscious mind, and it is hugely important to keep in touch with what makes it tick. If we get so caught up in narcissistic academic literalism that we dismiss intuition as nonexistent because we don’t fully understand it, or if we blithely consider the unconscious to be a piece of machinery that operates mystically in a realm that we have no connection to, then we lose the rich opportunity to have open communication with the wellspring of our creativity.

What results is a network of deeply internalized, interconnected knowledge that expands from a central, personal locus point.

how can I make time slow down without breaking a limb? Everyone has heard stories of women lifting cars off their children or of time seeming to slow down during a car accident or a fall down the stairs. Clearly, there is a survival mechanism that allows human beings to channel their physical and mental capacities to an astonishing degree of intensity in life-or-death moments. But can we do this at will?

In every discipline, the ability to be clearheaded, present, cool under fire is much of what separates the best from the mediocre. In competition, the dynamic is often painfully transparent. If one player is serenely present while the other is being ripped apart by internal issues, the outcome is already clear. The prey is no longer objective, makes compounding mistakes, and the predator moves in for the kill. While more subtle, this issue is perhaps even more critical in solitary pursuits such as writing, painting, scholarly thinking, or learning. In the absence of continual external reinforcement, we must be our own monitor, and quality of presence is often the best gauge. We cannot expect to touch excellence if “going through the motions” is the norm of our lives. On the other hand, if deep, fluid presence becomes second nature, then life, art, and learning take on a richness that will continually surprise and delight.

The secret is that everything is always on the line. The more present we are at practice, the more present we will be in competition, in the boardroom, at the exam, the operating table, the big stage. If we have any hope of attaining excellence, let alone of showing what we’ve got under pressure, we have to be prepared by a lifestyle of reinforcement. Presence must be like breathing.

At a high level the chess world has many big games and in long, grueling tournaments they tend to follow one another, over and over, for days and weeks at a time. I knew how to block out my issues in a sprint, but in marathons I ran out of gas. Consistency became a critical problem. On days that I was inspired, I was unstoppable. But other days I would play bad chess. The time had come for me to learn the science of long-term, healthy, self-sustaining peak performance.

What is fascinating about this method of physical conditioning is that after just a few weeks I noticed a tangible difference in my ability to relax and recover between arduous thought processes in a chess game. At LGE they had discovered that there is a clear physiological connection when it comes to recovery—cardiovascular interval training can have a profound effect on your ability to quickly release tension and recover from mental exhaustion. What is more, physical flushing and mental clarity are very much intertwined.

To this day, virtually every element of my physical training revolves around one form or another of stress and recovery. For example, during weight workouts, the LGE guys taught me to precisely monitor how much time I leave between sets, so that my muscles have ample time to recover, but are still pushed to improve their recovery time.

Ultimately, with incremental training very much like what I described in the chapter Making Smaller Circles, recovery time can become nearly instantaneous. And once the act of recovery is in our blood, we’ll be able to access it under the most strained of circumstances, becoming masters of creating tiny havens for renewal, even where observers could not conceive of such a break.

In your performance training, the first step to mastering the zone is to practice the ebb and flow of stress and recovery. This should involve interval training as I have described above, at whatever level of difficulty is appropriate for the age and physical conditioning of the individual. This training could, of course, take many forms: I have already mentioned biking and resistance work, but let’s say you enjoy swimming laps in a pool. Instead of just swimming until you are exhausted and then quitting, push yourself to your healthy limit, then recover for a minute or two, and then push yourself again. Create a rhythm of intervals like the one I described with my biking. With practice, increase the intensity and duration of your sprint time, and gradually condense rest periods—you are on your way! This same pattern can be used with jogging, weight lifting, martial arts training, or playing any sport that involves cardiovascular work.

Interval work is a critical building block to becoming a consistent long-term performer. If you spend a few months practicing stress and recovery in your everyday life, you’ll lay the physiological foundation for becoming a resilient, dependable pressure player.

One of the biggest roadblocks to releasing the tension during breaks of intense competition or in any other kind of challenging environment is the fear of whether we will be able to get it back. If getting focused is hit or miss, how can we give up our focus once we’ve finally got it? Conditioning to this insecurity begins young. As children, we might be told to “concentrate” by parents and teachers, and then be reprimanded if we look off into the stars. So the child learns to associate not focusing with being “bad.” The result is that we concentrate with everything we’ve got until we can’t withstand the pressure and have a meltdown.

We don’t live within a Hollywood screenplay where the crescendo erupts just when we want it to, and more often than not the climactic moments in our lives will follow many unclimactic, normal, humdrum hours, days, weeks, or years. So how do we step up when our moment suddenly arises? My answer is to redefine the question. Not only do we have to be good at waiting, we have to love it.

The next step of the process is to gradually alter the routine so that it is similar enough so as to have the same physiological effect, but slightly different so as to make the “trigger” both lower-maintenance and more flexible. The key is to make the changes incrementally, slowly, so there is more similarity than difference from the last version of the routine. This way the body and mind have the same physiological reaction even if the preparation is slightly shorter.

There are performers who recognize the disruptive potential of emotions and try to turn them off, become cold, detached, steely. For some personalities this might work, although in my opinion denial tends to melt down when the pressure becomes fierce. Then there are those elite performers who use emotion, observing their moment and then channeling everything into a deeper focus that generates a uniquely flavored creativity. This is an interesting, resilient approach based on flexibility and subtle introspective awareness. Instead of being bullied by or denying their unconscious, these players let their internal movements flavor their fires.

As we enter into this discussion, please keep in mind the three steps I described as being critical to resilient, self-sufficient performance. First, we learn to flow with distraction, like that blade of grass bending to the wind. Then we learn to use distraction, inspiring ourselves with what initially would have thrown us off our games. Finally we learn to re-create the inspiring settings internally. We learn to make sandals.

The only way to succeed is to acknowledge reality and funnel it, take the nerves and use them. We must be prepared for imperfection. If we rely on having no nerves, on not being thrown off by a big miss, or on the exact replication of a certain mindset, then when the pressure is high enough, or when the pain is too piercing to ignore, our ideal state will shatter.

In those days pitchers threw at batters all the time. The Reds were playing a three-game series against St. Louis, and in the first game, Robinson got hit by a pitch and went on to have a phenomenal night. The next day the pitcher hit Robinson again, and he just destroyed the Cardinals throughout the whole series. A week later, the two teams played another series, but before it began Red Schoendienst, the St. Louis manager—and Keith’s first manager—called a team meeting and said “The first pitcher who hits Frank Robinson is fined one hundred bucks! Just leave him alone!” Keith loves this story. It represents what a truly dominant competitor should be all about. Guys like Miller, Jordan, Hernandez, and Robinson are so far beyond shakable that opponents, instead of playing mental games, cower for fear of inspiring them.

The next step in my training would be to channel my gut reaction into intensity. This is not so hard once you get comfortable in that heated-up place. It is more about sweeping away the cobwebs than about learning anything new. We are built to be sharpest when in danger, but protected lives have distanced us from our natural abilities to channel our energies. Instead of running from our emotions or being swept away by their initial gusts, we should learn to sit with them, become at peace with their unique flavors, and ultimately discover deep pools of inspiration. I have found that this is a natural process. Once we build our tolerance for turbulence and are no longer upended by the swells of our emotional life, we can ride them and even pick up speed with their slopes.

But how do you play your best when there is no one around to provide motivation? There is no cookie-cutter mold to inspiration. There is, however, a process we can follow to discover our unique path. First, we cultivate The Soft Zone, we sit with our emotions, observe them, work with them, learn how to let them float away if they are rocking our boat, and how to use them when they are fueling our creativity. Then we turn our weaknesses into strengths until there is no denial of our natural eruptions and nerves sharpen our game, fear alerts us, anger funnels into focus.

I have talked about style, personal taste, being true to your natural disposition. This theme is critical at all stages of the learning process. If you think about the high-end learning principles that I have discussed in this book, they all spring out of the deep, creative plunge into an initially small pool of information. In the early chapters, I described the importance of a chess player laying a solid foundation by studying positions of reduced complexity (endgame before opening). Then we apply the internalized principles to increasingly complex scenarios. In Making Smaller Circles we take a single technique or idea and practice it until we feel its essence. Then we gradually condense the movements while maintaining their power, until we are left with an extremely potent and nearly invisible arsenal. In Slowing Down Time, we again focus on a select group of techniques and internalize them until the mind perceives them in tremendous detail. After training in this manner, we can see more frames in an equal amount of time, so things feel slowed down.

When I think about creativity, it is always in relation to a foundation. We have our knowledge. It becomes deeply internalized until we can access it without thinking about it. Then we have a leap that uses what we know to go one or two steps further. We make a discovery. Most people stop here and hope that they will become inspired and reach that state of “divine insight” again. In my mind, this is a missed opportunity. Imagine that you are building a pyramid of knowledge. Every level is constructed of technical information and principles that explain that information and condense it into chunks (as I explained in the chapter Slowing Down Time). Once you have internalized enough information to complete one level of the pyramid, you move on to the next. Say you are ten or twelve levels in. Then you have a creative burst like the ones Dan and I had in the ring. In that moment, it is as if you are seeing something that is suspended in the sky just above the top of your pyramid. There is a connection between that discovery and what you know—or else you wouldn’t have discovered it—and you can find that connection if you try. The next step is to figure out the technical components of your creation. Figure out what makes the “magic” tick.

Conditions might not be calm or reasonable. It may feel as though the whole world is stacked against us. This is when we have to perform better than we ever conceived of performing.

When we imagine a machine, the result is always something close to a mechanical system that works by itself. It doesn’t bother us to think that it’s nothing beyond that. But how do we feel when we imagine ourselves as a machine? Empty. We have the feeling that something is missing. And what is missing? What’s there in a human that is missing in a machine? Illusion. The emptiness of the machine is the consciousness that our subjective world is a fiction; the consciousness that our humanity is a delirium, and that there’s nothing behind what we are living. We are machines, and our consciousness is a dream of this machine. Nothing else. Absolutely nothing.

To reduce man to nothing, and to understand that this demonstrates existential nihilism, we must grasp the objective emptiness of existence – being obvious that, as subjects, we can only do so subjectively. The problem is that, in the process of demonstrating that existence itself is empty, we are the very emptiness we are trying to point out – we try to explain that we ourselves have no explanation. It may seem paradoxical, but it is not. Once we understand ourselves as a fact, nihilism will follow as a rather obvious consequence.

if we put our personal interests aside, we will see that what troubles us in nihilism is the fact that it harshly confronts us with our own naiveté; that we have been so foolishly deceived that our lives have come to rely on lies, on imaginary assumptions. Therefore, let us realize that when nihilism points out these lies, it is not destroying reality, but our illusions. In this view, nihilism is nothing more than an exercise in honesty and impartiality, and only empties the reality of fictions that never really existed.

Instead of observing facts, we must seek explanations of pure reason, wondering about some supernatural essence that determines natural facts.

The fact is that this delusional metaphysics would never have been born if we had given the Greeks a microscope and a periodic table. Viewed in this way, the most profound metaphysical investigations are a pure and simple waste of time, for they are in search of something that is simply not there – and the vast majority of the questions of existence, the questions we consider most important, are raised not by physics, but by metaphysics, by the most shameful inquisitive babble. If such observations seem strong, this is because even today our modern view of reality still hides many metaphysical biases. Let us think, for example, about the raison d’être of life. Where do we get this crazy idea? Certainly not from experience, certainly not from the world before our eyes. This is an unreasonable metaphysical question, for it is something that could under no circumstances be solved by observation of the physical world, and this can be illustrated by the simple fact that the observation of the physical world made by modern biology, while explaining perfectly well how life works, is not accepted as an answer to this question.

Therefore, in order to transform any absurd belief into a glorious “metaphysical inquiry,” it is enough to put a question mark at its end: we will have before us another “unfathomable mystery”, another proof of man’s profound ignorance of the world in which he lives. However, let us be frank: were not we ourselves that, for no respectable reason, invented that the flower has a “raison d’être”, that it must have a reason? We turn this circular reasoning into something so grand that by investigating it we have the illusion of walking straight. We are lost in reveries, and we call it “transcendental meditations,” “searching for the inner sense of being,” which is nothing more than a man running around his own tail for reasons that fill his vanity.

When we say that “all living beings are born, grow, reproduce and die,” we make a scientific statement that can be observed.

traditional metaphysics is essentialist, that is, it assumes that everything that exists has an “essence” that makes it what it is. The role of metaphysical reflection, in this perspective, would be to rationally investigate such “essence”, since the observed facts would be its mere manifestation. It has already been said that this essence is fire, water, numbers, reasons, gods, etc.; today it is said that this essence is foolishness. Such metaphysics does not care to understand the world we are in: it seeks to understand a transcendental world of imaginary essences of which ours would be the result. Its investigations presuppose an order of things that is extrinsic to being, that is, supernatural. It seeks to discover an essence which is also an explanation: the reason the world exists. This type of questioning, of course, would only be compatible with a world that had a “transcendent essence,” which refers to the idea of a “subjectivity behind the world.” That is why we say that traditional metaphysics has a theological orientation, because it confers divine attributes to existence. This kind of metaphysical inquiry seems like philosophy, but it is actually theology.

A view that rejected metaphysics indistinctly would not allow us to make any assumptions about reality that were beyond immediate experience.

As you can see, today the field of metaphysics is much more modest, and it seeks only to understand what reality is and how our relationship with it occurs. It seeks to explain how it is possible to understand the world objectively, not from the subjective view of an “absolute being”, but from the subjective view of man, which is contained in, and not above, natural reality. Therefore, what we now call metaphysics is not the attempt to investigate what exists “beyond” physics, but beyond immediate experience. It seeks to distinguish what exists in itself – and which would exist even if we did not exist – from what exists only in our minds. With this approach, we no longer try to justify the world, but knowledge.

This naturalization movement has profound implications on how we think the world and man’s place in existence – and since this shift in perspective is relatively recent, we still carry many metaphysical prejudices inherited from traditional, essentialist metaphysics. The relation of nihilism to metaphysics, in this case, would be the attempt to understand the implications of reducing man to the natural. Existential nihilism denies that there is any meaning in seeking a subjective meaning in the objective world, outside of man. That is, the investigation of the natural reality can never involve subjective questions, for we cannot investigate them by observing natural facts.

nihilism has the uncomfortable role of recycling senseless investigations. It is not really an ideology, an idea with any “positive” goal, but a posture of analytical and rectifying reflection.

Up to this point, we have been concerned with explaining that the emptiness of existence stems from recognizing the non-human character of the world itself. From now on, we will be devoted to delineating with greater clarity what this non-human world would be, distinguishing it from our subjective universe. Our first observation will be about the quest for knowledge. That one thing is missing, but it is important. Then we will begin to delineate the distinction between objective and subjective in detail, and give some examples of “application” of nihilism as an analytical procedure.

As our contact with reality happens through this partial view, created by ourselves, two problems arise. First, our representation of reality is committed not to science, but to survival. Second, as being aware of all this complexity is not biologically relevant, we do not distinguish between both things – and so the subjective seems something objective, as if our consciousness, our mental representation of the world, were the world itself, which leads us to humanize what we observe, transposing our representation of reality, which is interior, to the outside world.

This kind of reverse reasoning, which seeks intentionality in things, is only permissible in subjective matters. For example, just as buildings have foundations, concrete columns, steel reinforcements, elevators, windows, floors, doors, and just as each of these elements has a structure and purpose, if the universe had been designed, there would be an “Intelligible reason” which constitutes its essence and which explains why each thing is as it is, and not something else. The essence of the world itself would be equivalent to the intention of the engineer who projected it – and it is only in this light that this kind of metaphysical investigation would make sense, but we would have to assume that it had a creator.

Nihilism operates a kind of “sterilization of being,” eliminating all its subjective elements: it removes from being all life, all movement, all meaning and sense, that is, dehumanizes it, de-characterizes it to such a point that it becomes indistinguishable from anything else. This allows us to take a raw view of what we are looking at, seeing it stripped of anthropomorphisms, reduced to its crude objective existence, which is to say reduced to nothing, that is, to nothing but itself.

In the 1980s and 1990s there were key problems cypherpunks were trying to solve before they could get there. One is that digital coins, unlike cash, are just computer code that can easily be replicated and falsified. The problem, known as “double spend,” can be solved using a centralized entity that keeps a record on the coins and authenticates them, but the challenge was to transfer value without having to trust a third party. Another issue to address in peer-to-peer, pseudonymous systems was Sybil attacks. Just as coins can be replicated in a digital world, so can identities. This is a problem in a network of equal peers because an attacker could create a large number of pseudonymous identities to gain a disproportionately large influence.

Metaphysics is not even justified as a preventive measure against the supposedly “pernicious” implications of nihilism, for nothingness cannot be put into practice. Nihilism destroys only illusions, and this only happens intellectually. There are no direct practical implications. To clarify this point, let us think as follows: has anyone ever heard of any holocaust committed in the name of uncertainty? Of martyrs who gave their lives for disbelief? Nobody kills in the name of doubt, no one sacrifices himself for reality. All wars we fight rest on some certainty, and all certainties are metaphysical beliefs to justify our absurdities.

Since, in the long term, nihilism is incompatible with the maintenance of life, it is quite common to hear that it is only a “provisional state,” something to be “overcome.” And this is correct. However, we should not confuse the overcoming of practical nihilism with refuting theoretical nihilism – flirting with that optimistic relativism that seems a like a praise of dementia.

If you’re surrounding yourself with people that are constantly draining your energy and keeping you in a negative mindset, life will feel like you’re walking through quicksand. Surrounding yourself with positive and supportive people will give you the extra boost you need to complete the goals that your normal energy levels couldn’t handle. You're almost always immersed in both worlds, surrounded by countless triggers that have the potential to drain your energy or charge it.

When communicating, it’s important to know your audience. When you’re talking to someone, identifying their boundaries, attributes and values can largely affect how you share your message. If you’re conversing with someone and you cross their boundaries or speak against their values, chances are they’ll interpret your information in an unfavorable way. There’s also a good chance that they’ll change their interpretation of you. If you really want to get your message across, you must deliver it in a way that’s within the receiver’s boundaries.

One of the reasons why I find Laches so interesting is that "courage" is an idea frequently referred to by gamers. Socrates is a soldier, so it’s natural for him to think about it. I have never held a weapon in my life, but chess is a war game, and I have fought thousands of virtual battles, sometimes for stakes high enough that I seriously cared about the outcome. In most games, a point comes when a crucial decision has to be made, and then you find people talking about courage. Socrates skilfully shows how people think they know what courage is, but as soon as you start picking at the definition you find that it’s remarkably hard to separate it from other desirable qualities such as foresight, balance and judgement. Every chessplayer knows how difficult it is to decide what to do when you’ve got yourself into an inferior position. You usually have to make a choice between passively defending on one hand and counter-attacking on the other. A beginner thinks it’s obvious: the coward sits and defends, the brave man counter-attacks. But as soon as you’ve got a reasonable amount of experience, you see that it’s anything but clear. Very often, your opponent is bluffing. He’s hoping to lure you into a foolhardy counter-attack, and true courage consists in standing your ground and refusing to be provoked. As Socrates demonstrates, it’s almost impossible to draw a clear line between courage and wisdom.

The central question examined in Protagoras and Meno is remarkably similar to the one in Asimov’s robot stories: is it possible to reduce virtuous behavior to a set of rules? It doesn’t seem impossible that Asimov, who was very well-read, knowingly adapted Plato’s ideas — he said himself that he adapted Gibbon for the Foundation series.

I call this the leisure-as-liberation trend in technological design. The idea behind this trend is very simple: the role of technologies is to liberate us from the chores that prevent us from having the leisure time we need to be human. This is the idea we see at work not only in the Roomba but also in online shopping, in voice-activated assistants, in predictive algorithms, and in the development of autonomous cars, autonomous robots, and autonomous drones.

As technologies have always been part of human development, we should not fear what they are doing to us but strive to learn more about them and to take a more active role in their design, as technologies have been and will continue to be part of human development whether we like it or not.

Technologies go beyond providing us with goals and shaping our activities, they can also influence our values and shape our judgments. The values of efficiency and of objectivity lead us to necessarily judge technologies to be superior to humans, for which reason we not only prefer technological solutions to our problems but we increasingly see humans as inefficient, as biased, as problems—problems to be replaced by more trustworthy and dependable technologies.

Just as contemporary thinkers would not see themselves as technophiliacs but as technorealists, so too these thinkers of the past would not have seen themselves as technophobes but as technorealists. Indeed these earlier thinkers would have probably suggested that the label of technophobia is itself symptomatic of the effect modern technologies have on us, as to challenge the perceived positive benefits of technologies is to be seen as either a Luddite, an ingrate, or a paranoid conspiracy theorist. In other words, contemporary thinkers accuse thinkers of the past of not understanding what it means to be technological whereas thinkers of the past would accuse contemporary thinkers of not understanding what it means to be human.

If we can indeed take an active role in determining how technologies influence us, then to treat tech companies as our enemy is to risk letting tech companies determine these influences for us rather than with us. Alternatively, if technologies are warping our goals, our values, and our judgments in ways that we do not realize, then the more we try to work with tech companies, the more we will be at risk of becoming entrenched in a technological mindset, consequently making us less and less able to take a critical stance toward technologies. Working out which of these perspectives is correct is thus vital for ensuring that technologies are providing us leisure as a form of liberation rather than providing us leisure as a form of dehumanization.

Whereas Marx thought that we are distracted and deluded by ideology, by external influences preventing us from learning the truth of our situation, a truth that, once learned, would immediately lead us to unite and revolt, Nietzsche thought that we are distracted and deluded because we want to be. According to Nietzsche, we should be concerned less with dangerous external influences than with dangerous internal influences, internal influences such as our tendency to view life as a source of suffering rather than as a source of challenges that force us to adapt and grow.

If “good” could have multiple competing meanings, then so too could “progress,” for which reason Nietzsche does not ask whether humans have achieved progress since the dawn of Christianity; he asks how we define “progress” and whether this definition accords with what it means to be human. It is for this reason that I believe Nietzsche—though he did not write much specifically about technology—can still help us to address the question of whether technological progress accords with human progress.

The goal of this investigation is to move us away from the endless debates between techno-optimists and techno-pessimists about whether technological progress is making us better or making us worse, to move us instead toward interrogating how we define concepts like “progress,” “better,” and “worse,” toward interrogating how technologies both shape and are the result of such ideological definitions.

Google, however, is not proof that we have killed and buried God or that we have taken up the responsibility of giving our lives meaning, the responsibility that we had formerly outsourced to God. Google is instead proof that we have not yet escaped our nihilistic reliance on external sources of meaning. Hence even the death of Google would only lead to a search for the next Google to take its place. It is for this reason that we must not blame technologies or try to evade technologies—as if turning off technologies would turn off the influence of technologies on us—but instead endeavor to find ways to stop trying to evade ourselves and what it means to be human.

Plato originally introduces his Republic to answer the question that Thrasymachus raised, which is dramatized by the story of the Ring of Gyges: is there any reason why you shouldn’t behave entirely selfishly, except the fact that other people may then disapprove of you? Plato’s answer is that there is a much better reason. If you act like this, your mental country will be badly governed, and its notional citizens, who correspond to the different parts of your mind, will be unhappy in the same way that the citizens of a badly governed country are unhappy. Plato argues that the best form of government is an aristocracy where the mind is ruled by the Philosopher King, here being played by Sadness. He was not impressed by democracy, and in particular thought that a mind ruled by a democratic form of government, where all the impulses are considered equally important, will soon slide completely out of control. The worst elements will take power and the mind will be enslaved under their rule. Everyone will be miserable and frightened all the time, just as people are miserable and frightened in a totalitarian state.

The increasing supply means that large holders’ stakes will gradually decline relative to the total supply and ownership will tend to be more decentralized, while a declining growth rate avoids flooding the market with ether and pushing down its price.

In such instances it seems that “I don’t care” is less an expression of detachment from the world and more an expression of simply trying to avoid making a decision. Yet these two expressions are importantly interconnected. To avoid making a decision, even a seemingly trivial decision, is to be detached from the world.

This is what is meant by the existentialist motto: “Existence precedes essence.”[5] That you are always comes before what you are. But the fact of existence, the bare fact, leaves us with the pressure of defining it, of clothing it in the choices we make. When this pressure becomes too much we are tempted to use “duplicity,”[6] as Sartre puts it, to avoid the truth of our situation. This is not to say however that this is deception. To deceive one must be conscious of the truth so as to best hide it from view. If this were the case then we could simply stop deceiving ourselves or others about who we are and just be. Yet, like Nietzsche’s insight that forgiveness requires not just forgetting the offense but forgetting that one forgot,[7] here we find ourselves confronted by a deceiver who has been deceived, with the deception being that one sees oneself as actually being sincere.

What Sartre illustrates is how willing we are to focus on the “bigger picture” in order to not have to focus on the “small stuff,” consequently losing sight of the fact that the bigger picture is nothing but the accumulated small stuffs. Life is a series of nows, each now is significant, each now is integral to the unfolding of every other now. One cannot therefore remove the meaning from any one now without removing meaning from all other nows. And yet we do this all the time. This is why Sartre focuses on mundane incidents in mundane events.

The danger of the nihilism of everyday life is that if it is human to make decisions, to make oneself accountable, to be responsible, then to avoid decision-making is to avoid being human. But to understand this human, this all-too-human, attempt to avoid being human requires that we turn from Sartre to Nietzsche. For now that Sartre has helped to introduce us to nihilism, to what nihilism can look like in everyday life and to how it can even play a role in everyday situations like dating, we are better prepared to look to Nietzsche to help us to understand nihilism’s relationship not only with our everyday lives but with life itself, to understand where nihilism came from, what nihilism means, and what nihilism does.

The Genealogy thus pursues the origin and progression of nihilism by pursuing the origin and progression of morality, asking how competing moral value systems gave rise both to Christianity and to nihilism. It is for this reason that Nietzsche called the work a genealogy, as it is a project tracing out the lineage not of a family of people but of a family of concepts—concepts such as “good,” “evil,” “guilt,” and “sin.” Nietzsche treats these concepts therefore not as universal truths but as victors in a struggle for survival between competing moral value systems, a struggle that Christianity won so decisively that we no longer realize that any other morality could even be possible, just as, before Darwin, we had no realization that any other human species could have been possible.

Yet because of the circular nature of our moral thinking, because we take for granted that the “good” are good and that the “evil” are evil, to begin to question these value judgments is to reveal that it is faith rather than certainty that is underlying the morality we live by. Thus, as Nietzsche says at the outset of the Genealogy, we do not know ourselves. To achieve such knowledge we must question the value of our values,[14] a questioning which, according to Nietzsche, has never before been undertaken.

In the first essay of the Genealogy, Nietzsche uses his training as a philologist to trace the etymological evolution of moral values back to their pre-Christian roots, back to a time when there were at least two competing value systems: “master”[15] morality and “slave”[16] morality. The central concern of the essay is trying to figure out how the Judeo-Christian morality of the slaves defeated the warrior morality of the masters, or, in other words, how the meek inherited the Earth. The answer, according to Nietzsche, is that the slaves, because they were born weak, were forced to become clever, and thus they were able to outwit rather than outfight the masters, because the masters were born strong enough to remain stupid.

Life is for Nietzsche the “will to power”[35]—not to achieve political success nor to dominate others but, rather, the will to will. To will is to strive, to pursue, which requires both something to strive after, an end to pursue, and the ability to do what is necessary to achieve one’s goal, the ability to recognize and carry out the means to one’s end. Willing is thus more than mere wanting; there are many things we want but, lacking the will to get them, such things remain fantasies rather than realities we are willing to create.

The will to power is to strive after striving itself, to pursue pursuing, to have no other end but to be able to continue to will. “Power” here means overcoming, overcoming obstacles, limits, but also oneself, to overcome what one has already achieved and the gravitational pull that one’s achievements can have, dragging the will away from power to instead focus on preservation. But if life is the will to power, the will to overcoming, then the will to preservation, the will to maintaining the status quo, is the will turning against life, the will turning against willing, the will turning toward asceticism.

Having defined life as the will to power, Nietzsche sees the activities that have come to be regarded as normal and necessary as unhealthy because they are aimed at turning the will against itself. To meditate, to relax, is to not act, to will not to will. To work is to work for someone else, to bring about what someone else wills, to keep oneself too busy to be aware of one’s own will. To help is to feel powerful, not by willing but by being recognized for what one has already, for what one has to give to those in need. To form groups is to compromise one’s will in the service of the will of the many. To punish is to vent, to use the pretext of justice as a way to exercise one’s will against someone else, as a way to compensate

nihilism can be seen as “ambiguous,” as either “active” or as “passive,” as either “a sign of increased power of the spirit” or as “decline and recession of the power of the spirit.”[38] To question our values is to actively repudiate the taken-for-granted nature of our values, but our values have become weak enough to be seen as in need of questioning precisely because we have for so long passively accepted our values without question. Active nihilism could therefore be seen as both a result of passive nihilism and as a way to prevent the continued growth of passive nihilism.

Before we can begin to make such determinations we should first look at current debates surrounding the relationship between technology and what it means to be human, for a second objection that could be raised is that Nietzsche is simply too outdated to be of any relevance to contemporary issues. Nietzsche could be seen as having taken for granted that to be human is to be embodied, to be vulnerable, to be mortal, and that to be nihilistic is to evade our embodiment, to evade our vulnerability, to evade our mortality. But what if this presupposition is wrong, or at least, obsolete? What if embodiment, vulnerability, mortality are not necessary features of being human but are merely historically contingent features, features that belong to a phase of humanity, a phase that we may soon be able to leave behind?

Again, it may appear that transhumanists are likewise saying “God is dead,” but in reality they are saying, “Technology is God.” Nietzsche argues that science appears to challenge religion but only perpetuates religion by replacing “faith in God” with “faith in truth,”[57] positing truth as a value without “justification,”[58] taking for granted that it should guide all our actions. In much the same way, transhumanists have replaced “God” with “Technology.” In this replacement, the names we give to our values may have changed, but what the values represent, and the functions they serve, has not.

Does this mean you lose the infinite game if you’re not a paradigm-shifting physicist or a record-breaking ballplayer? No. It means you lose by not trying to play full out, by not trying to do the impossible—whatever that is for you. We are all capable of so much more than we know. This is the main lesson a lifetime in peak performance has taught me. Each of us, right here, right now, contains the possibility of extraordinary. Yet, this extraordinary capability is an emergent property, one that only arises when we push ourselves toward the edge of our abilities. Far beyond our comfort zone, that’s where we find out who we are and what we can be. In other words, the only real way to discover if you are capable of pulling off the impossible—whatever that is for you—is by attempting to pull off the impossible.

‘Anger carried to excess begets madness.’ How true this is you’re bound to know, having had both slaves and enemies. It is a passion, though, which flares up against all types of people. It is born of love as well as hate, and is as liable to arise in the course of sport or jesting as in affairs of a serious kind. The factor that counts is not the importance of the cause from which it springs but the kind of personality it lands in, in the same way as with fire what matters is not the fierceness of the flame but where it catches – solid objects may resist the fiercest flame while, conversely, dry and inflammable matter will nurse a mere spark into a conflagration. It is true, my dear Lucilius. The outcome of violent anger is a mental raving, and therefore anger is to be avoided not for the sake of moderation but for the sake of sanity.

Scientists used to believe that dopamine was simply a reward drug, meaning this neurochemical showed up after we accomplished a goal as a way of reinforcing goal attainment. We now know that dopamine is actually the brain’s way of encouraging us to act—meaning the chemical doesn’t show up after we take a risk, to reward our risk-taking. Rather it arrives right before we take that risk, to encourage our risk-taking. In other words, dopamine is the biological basis of exploration and innovation.

As a flow trigger, mastery is referred to as the “challenge-skills balance.”20 The idea is relatively straightforward: Flow follows focus, and we pay the most attention to the task at hand, when the challenge of that task slightly exceeds our skill set. We want to stretch, but not snap.

Much of what remains visible is simply the stuff that scares us. Evolution shaped the brain for survival, so anything that could threaten that survival always grabs our attention. But what else is important for our survival? Our goals, and anything that can help us achieve those goals. Because the brain is a prediction engine and consciousness is a limited resource, fear and goals are the basic building blocks of our reality.

This is the foundational neurobiology, but what Deci and Ryan discovered is that there’s an order to this process.9 For goals to be most effective at shaping perception, there’s a requisite first step. We need to know our needs—that is, our intrinsic motivations—before we can utilize goals as a way of fulfilling those needs. That’s why this book started where it did. With passion and purpose properly stacked atop autonomy and mastery, we’re now positioned to get the maximum benefit from goal setting.

When goals are clear, the mind doesn’t have to wonder about what to do or what to do next—it already knows.

Psychologists have found that humans can achieve three levels of well-being on this planet, each more pleasurable than the last.9 The first level is moment-to-moment “happiness” or what’s often described as a hedonic approach to life. The next level up is “engagement,” which is defined as a high-flow lifestyle, or one where happiness is achieved not by the pursuit of pleasure but rather through seeking out challenging tasks that have a high likelihood of producing flow. The next level up, the peak level of happiness and the best we get to feel on the planet, is known as “purpose,” which blends the high-flow lifestyle of level two with the desire to impact lives beyond our own.

Less gritty people hunt happiness through pleasure, while grittier folks choose engagement.

Thus, while grit requires more energy and emotional fortitude in the short run, it provides a much bigger boost in mood and motivation in the long run.

My version is two hundred push-ups. My longtime editor, Michael Wharton, prefers a twenty-minute run. The point is to find something hard enough to remind yourself that you’re gritty enough to get it done, especially when you can’t do much else. That reminder is the point.

Here’s Wallace: Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. . . . And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let’s get concrete. . . . There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I’m talking about.

There’s a little gap, no more than a millisecond, between the moment a thought arises and the moment our brain attaches an emotion to that thought. Once that feeling is attached, especially if it’s negative, there’s usually too much energy in the system to shut it down. But if you can get into that gap between thought and emotion, you can replace a bad thought with a better one, neutralizing the stress response in the short term and reprogramming the brain in the long term.

Tufts professor emeritus of psychiatry Keith Ablow solves this with a bit of cognitive reframing. “I maintain a very strong philosophical position that being burnt out is a good thing. When I’m exhausted because of work done for a worthy goal, my exhaustion is an offering. By seeing it this way, I’m reframing exhaustion from a negative to a positive, and this confers a certain immunity to exhaustion. It also dampens down fear, which can often be the by-product of exhaustion, but is a huge barrier to creativity. Just lowering anxiety a bit seems to free up hidden levels of innovative thinking.”

What’s more, a growth mindset saves you time. It means your brain is ready to absorb new knowledge, so you don’t waste hours spinning wheels. It’s also a critical way to limit negative self-talk, which, because it impacts our ability to find connections between ideas, is another barrier to learning. More crucial, a growth mindset helps you see mistakes as opportunities for improvement rather than condemnations of character, ensuring you’ll get farther faster, and with much less emotional turmoil along the way.

I think the actual number probably differs for everybody, but when I approach a new subject my rule of thumb is to allow myself five books’ worth of stupid. That is, I pick five books on a subject and read them all without judging my learning along the way. This point is worth reiterating: learning doesn’t make us feel smart. At least, not at first. At first, learning makes us feel stupid. New concepts and new terminology can often add up to new frustrations. But don’t judge yourself for the stupidity you feel along the way. On the path to peak performance, quite often, your emotions don’t mean what you think they mean.

Whenever we encounter a difficult situation, the brain makes a basic risk assessment based on the quality and quantity of our close relationships. If you have friends and family around to help you attack a problem, your potential for actually solving that problem increases significantly. The brain treats the situation as an interesting challenge, not a dangerous threat. The result is dopamine. The brain gives you a squirt of the good stuff to prepare you to rise to that challenge.

But in the 1990s, brain-imaging technology improved to the point that scientists could begin to map the neuron-by-neuron pathways of our basic emotions.4 This work ended a half century’s worth of controversy and led to the discovery of the seven aforementioned emotional systems present in all animals, including humans. And systems is the operative word. Emotions don’t come from any single location in the brain. Instead, they’re generated by those seven core networks: fear, lust, care, play, rage, seeking, and panic/grief. Each of these networks is a specific electrochemical pathway through the brain that produces specific feelings and behaviors. Thus, emotional intelligence, from a neurobiological perspective, can be thought of as the cognitive capacities needed to effectively “manage” each of these seven networks.

One of the most important goals of good design is for a system to be obvious. This is the opposite of high cognitive load and unknown unknowns. In an obvious system, a developer can quickly understand how the existing code works and what is required to make a change. An obvious system is one where a developer can make a quick guess about what to do, without thinking very hard, and yet be confident that the guess is correct.

As a result, planning for the future isn’t a priority. You don’t spend much time looking for the best design; you just want to get something working soon.

In trying to sort out what accounts for a person’s ability to cope with stress, it is useful to distinguish three different kinds of resources. The first is the external support available, and especially the network of social supports. A major illness, for instance, will be mitigated to a certain extent if one has good insurance and a loving family. The second bulwark against stress includes a person’s psychological resources, such as intelligence, education, and relevant personality factors. Moving to a new city and having to establish new friendships will be more stressful to an introvert than to an extrovert. And finally, the third type of resource refers to the coping strategies that a person uses to confront the stress.

2. Focusing attention on the world. It is difficult to notice the environment as long as attention is mainly focused inward, as long as most of one’s psychic energy is absorbed by the concerns and desires of the ego. People who know how to transform stress into enjoyable challenge spend very little time thinking about themselves. They are not expending all their energy trying to satisfy what they believe to be their needs, or worrying about socially conditioned desires. Instead their attention is alert, constantly processing information from their surroundings. The focus is still set by the person’s goal, but it is open enough to notice and adapt to external events even if they are not directly relevant to what he wants to accomplish.

Module depth is a way of thinking about cost versus benefit. The benefit provided by a module is its functionality. The cost of a module (in terms of system complexity) is its interface. A module’s interface represents the complexity that the module imposes on the rest of the system: the smaller and simpler the interface, the less complexity that it introduces. The best modules are those with the greatest benefit and the least cost.

Another example of a deep module is the garbage collector in a language such as Go or Java. This module has no interface at all; it works invisibly behind the scenes to reclaim unused memory. Adding garbage collection to a system actually shrinks its overall interface, since it eliminates the interface for freeing objects. The implementation of a garbage collector is quite complex, but that complexity is hidden from programmers using the language.

The best form of information hiding is when information is totally hidden within a module, so that it is irrelevant and invisible to users of the module. However, partial information hiding also has value. For example, if a particular feature or piece of information is only needed by a few of a class’s users, and it is accessed through separate methods so that it isn’t visible in the most common use cases, then that information is mostly hidden. Such information will create fewer dependencies than information that is visible to every user of the class.

Another possible approach is to pull the information out of all of the affected classes and create a new class that encapsulates just that information. However, this approach will be effective only if you can find a simple interface that abstracts away from the details; if the new class exposes most of the knowledge through its interface, then it won’t provide much value

In temporal decomposition, execution order is reflected in the code structure: operations that happen at different times are in different methods or classes. If the same knowledge is used at different points in execution, it gets encoded in multiple places, resulting in information leakage.

information hiding can often be improved by making a class slightly larger. One reason for doing this is to bring together all of the code related to a particular capability (such as parsing an HTTP request), so that the resulting class contains everything related to that capability.

These words, written in 1907, are as true today as ever. So, why do we place such emphasis on talent? And why fixate on the extreme limits of what we might do when, in fact, most of us are at the very beginning of our journey, so far, far away from those outer bounds? And why do we assume that it is our talent, rather than our effort, that will decide where we end up in the very long run?

If in the course of asking yourself these “Why?” questions your answer is simply “Just because!” then you know you’ve gotten to the top of a goal hierarchy. The top-level goal is not a means to any other end. It is, instead, an end in itself. Some psychologists like to call this an “ultimate concern.”13 Myself, I think of this top-level goal as a compass that gives direction and meaning to all the goals below it.

Indeed, giving up on lower-level goals is not only forgivable, it’s sometimes absolutely necessary. You should give up when one lower-level goal can be swapped for another that is more feasible.

First comes interest. Passion begins with intrinsically enjoying what you do. Every gritty person I’ve studied can point to aspects of their work they enjoy less than others, and most have to put up with at least one or two chores they don’t enjoy at all.

Gritty people do more deliberate practice and experience more flow. There’s no contradiction here, for two reasons. First, deliberate practice is a behavior, and flow is an experience. Anders Ericsson is talking about what experts do; Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is talking about how experts feel. Second, you don’t have to be doing deliberate practice and experiencing flow at the same time. And, in fact, I think that for most experts, they rarely go together.

That modern technology has reduced nature to an on-demand power source, to a power source that we can control, does not mean that we are ourselves the masters of this process of reduction and subservience, for we have likewise been reduced and made subservient as standing-reserve, as we must be available on demand in order to control and make use of these on-demand power sources as needed. In other words, modern technology not only challenges nature, revealing nature as a power source to be stockpiled, but first and foremost challenges humanity, revealing humanity as the power source to do the stockpiling.

Instead of worrying about how he is doing, how he looks from the outside, he is wholeheartedly committed to his goals.

The number of steps is irrelevant; what counts is that most theories recognize the importance of this dialectic tension, this alternation between differentiation on the one hand and integration on the other. From this point of view, individual life appears to consist of a series of different “games,” with different goals and challenges, that change with time as a person matures. Complexity requires that we invest energy in developing whatever skills we were born with, in becoming autonomous, self-reliant, conscious of our uniqueness and of its limitations. At the same time we must invest energy in recognizing, understanding, and finding ways to adapt to the forces beyond the boundaries of our own individuality. Of course we don’t have to undertake any of these plans. But if we don’t, chances are, sooner or later, we will regret it. FORGING RESOLVE Purpose gives direction to one’s efforts, but it does not necessarily make life easier. Goals can lead into all sorts of trouble, at which point one gets tempted to give them up and find some less demanding script by which to order one’s actions. The price one pays for changing goals whenever opposition threatens is that while one may achieve a more pleasant and comfortable life, it is likely that it will end up empty and void of meaning.

Like Thrasymachus in Plato’s Republic, Duryodhana sees morality as a veiled way to protect the interests of the powerful.47 As he sees it, what people call ‘dharma’ is really a clever way of advancing those interests.

It is thus possible for the envier to want something but without wishing the envied to lose it at the same time. This positive sort of envy that my father alluded to leads to ambition, to want to emulate the successful, but without the malicious desire to deprive the rival of the possession. This is called ‘benign’ or ‘emulative’ envy and it is the one on display when one says to a friend, ‘I envy you for such and such skill.’

Dharma is easiest to spot by its absence: the Mahabharata employs the pedagogical technique of teaching about dharma via its opposite, adharma. Duryodhana’s envy is adharma. Yet, it is a natural and universal emotion, common to all human beings. It is all-pervasive and hence the proverb: ‘If envy were a fever the whole world would be ill’. It is also fearsome. When a person is unable to tolerate the good fortune of others, and when she cannot have what they do, she prefers to spoil it for everyone. This ability to make everyone worse off means that not only ordinary human beings but also rulers must take envy seriously, and not dismiss it merely as human frailty. We ought to be concerned about its terrible ability to damage both our personal and our public life.

If God is not the arbiter of dharma, and if the Vedas are contradictory, and if wise persons cannot agree about right and wrong, where does it leave the ordinary individual? Kulluka, who wrote a commentary in the fifteenth century on Manu’s verse quoted above, declares that the ‘satisfaction of the mind is the only authority in cases of conflicting alternatives’. 54   The classical poet, Kalidasa, who lived in the fifth century AD , was of the same view: ‘In matters where doubt intervenes, the [natural] inclination of the heart of the good person becomes the “authority" or the decisive factor.’ 55   This explains why the characters in the Mahabharata and in other texts of the classical Indian tradition prefer to depend on reason rather than on blind faith.

The attraction of Consequentialism is its simplicity. I can quickly tell if I am being good by examining the consequences of my act. Everyone is equal in the equation, whether a servant or a master.22 My criticism of it is that it ignores the justice or fairness in the distribution of goods. It is indifferent to the needs of the weak and the poor as long as society’s overall satisfaction is maximized.23 Indeed, it is all too easy to ignore the circumstances and the freedom of a minority in maximizing the welfare of society as a whole.

Among the officials of the state are schoolteachers in government primary schools in India, who fail dharma when they are absent. The Mahabharata has offered a number of reasons to these schoolteachers to be good. First, because it is one’s duty; second, good acts produce good consequences; third, the social order would collapse if people did not keep to their commitments; finally, virtue or dharma is necessary for leading a good and flourishing life.

Karl von Clausewitz, the German strategist, set out to explain the ‘inner meaning’ of war. He wrote, ‘War has no limits to violence . . . [The reason is that] each of the adversaries forces the hand of the other, and this results in continuous escalation, in which neither side is guilty even if it acts first, since every act can be called pre-emptive.’ 16   Once war begins, it inevitably escalates, without limit. (When Winston Churchill made the decision to fight Adolf Hitler, he did not know that the war would escalate into the fire-bombing of German cities in which thousands of civilians would die.) Great tragedy is inescapable in war.

When an individual acts for the sake of his work rather than for the personal reward from it, Krishna says, the individual is likely to do the right thing. This moral insight is famously called nishkama karma or nishphala karma . ‘ Nish ’ means ‘without’ in Sanskrit; ‘ kama ’ means desire; ‘ phala ’ is fruit; ‘karma’ is action—literally, ‘disinterested action’ or an action performed without thinking of its fruit.

Kubernetes uses Docker as its default container runtime — the low-level technology that pulls images and starts and stops containers. However, Kubernetes has a pluggable container runtime interface (CRI) that makes it easy to swap-out Docker for a different container runtime. In the future, Docker might be replaced by containerd as the default container runtime in Kubernetes.

It can happen only when the mind knows not only what is but also what could be. The more complex any system, the more room it leaves open for alternatives, and the more things can go wrong with it. This is certainly applicable to the evolution of the mind: as it has increased its power to handle information, the potential for inner conflict has increased as well. When there are too many demands, options, challenges, we become anxious; when too few, we get bored.

Few would argue that a simpler consciousness, no matter how harmonious, is preferable to a more complex one. While we might admire the serenity of the lion in repose, the tribesman’s untroubled acceptance of his fate, or the child’s wholehearted involvement in the present, they cannot offer a model for resolving our predicament. The order based on innocence is now beyond our grasp. Once the fruit is plucked from the tree of knowledge, the way back to Eden is barred forever.

The Mahabharata calls its war a dharma-yuddha , a ‘just war’. The epic’s language is full of words of moral judgment—aggression, self-defence, appeasement, cruelty, atrocity, massacre. It is profoundly aware that a just war can be fought unjustly, just as an unjust war can be fought in strict accordance with the rules. It examines three aspects of the Kurukshetra War: its causes, its conduct, and its consequences. Medieval scholastics in the Catholic ‘just war’ tradition called these three jus ad bellum (cause), jus in bello (conduct) and jus post bellum (consequences). Whereas this chapter focuses on the first; Chapter 7 ( will examine the second; and Chapter 9 will look in on the third.

If there is a strategy shared by these and by other people who succeed in building meaning into their experience, it is one so simple and obvious that it is almost embarrassing to mention. Yet because it is so often overlooked, especially nowadays, it will be valuable to review it. The strategy consists in extracting from the order achieved by past generations patterns that will help avoid disorder in one’s own mind. There is much knowledge—or well-ordered information—accumulated in culture, ready for this use. Great music, architecture, art, poetry, drama, dance, philosophy, and religion are there for anyone to see as examples of how harmony can be imposed on chaos. Yet so many people ignore them, expecting to create meaning in their lives by their own devices.

One of the most important steps in therapy is helping people take responsibility for their current predicaments, because once they realize that they can (and must) construct their own lives, they’re free to generate change. Often, though, people carry around the belief that the majority of their problems are circumstantial or situational — which is to say, external. And if the problems are caused by everyone and everything else, by stuff out there, why should they bother to change themselves? Even if they decide to do things differently, won’t the rest of the world still be the same?

There are many ways to tell a story, and if I’ve learned anything as a therapist, it’s that most people are what therapists call “unreliable narrators.” That’s not to say that they purposely mislead. It’s more that every story has multiple threads, and they tend to leave out the strands that don’t jibe with their perspectives. Most of what patients tell me is absolutely true — from their current points of view. Ask about somebody’s spouse while they’re both still in love, then ask about that same spouse post-divorce, and each time, you’ll get only half the story.

Certainly we all have our deal-breakers.

By definition, the presenting problem is the issue that sends a person into therapy. It might be a panic attack, a job loss, a death, a birth, a relational difficulty, an inability to make a big life decision, or a bout of depression.

Sitting-with-you-in-your-pain is one of the rare experiences that people get in the protected space of a therapy room, but it’s very hard to give or get outside of it — even for Jen, who is a therapist.

When done well, self-disclosure can bridge some distance with patients who feel isolated in their experiences, and it can encourage more openness. But if it’s perceived as inappropriate or self-indulgent, the patient will feel uncomfortable and start to shut down — or simply flee.

In idiot compassion, you avoid rocking the boat to spare people’s feelings, even though the boat needs rocking and your compassion ends up being more harmful than your honesty.

If we don’t accept the notion that there’s no redo, much as we try to get our parents or siblings or partners to fix what happened years ago, our pasts will keep us stuck. Changing our relationship to the past is a staple of therapy. But we talk far less about how our relationship to the future informs the present too. Our notion of the future can be just as powerful a roadblock to change as our notion of the past.

The purpose of inquiring about people’s parents isn’t to join them in blaming, judging, or criticizing their parents. In fact, it’s not about their parents at all. It’s solely about understanding how their early experiences inform who they are as adults so that they can separate the past from the present (and not wear psychological clothing that no longer fits).

Self-esteem, fully realized, is the experience that we are appropriate to life and to the requirements of life. More specifically, self-esteem is: 1.   confidence in our ability to think, confidence in our ability to cope with the basic challenges of life; and 2.   confidence in our right to be successful and happy, the feeling of being worthy, deserving, entitled to assert our needs and wants, achieve our values, and enjoy the fruits of our efforts.

I’m always working with John on identifying his in-the-moment feelings, because feelings lead to behaviors. Once we know what we’re feeling, we can make choices about where we want to go with them.

We have more choices and options than ever before in every area. Frontiers of limitless possibilities now face us in whatever direction we look. To be adaptive in such an environment, to cope appropriately, we have a greater need for personal autonomy—because there is no widely accepted code of rules and rituals to spare us the challenge of individual decision making. We need to know who we are and to be centered within ourselves. We need to know what matters to us; otherwise it is easy to be swept up and swept along by alien values, pursuing goals that do not nourish who we really are.

The concept of “competence” as used in my definition is metaphysical, not “Western.” That is, it pertains to the very nature of things—to our fundamental relationship to reality.

To have high self-esteem, then, is to feel confidently appropriate to life, that is, competent and worthy in the sense I have indicated. To have low self-esteem is to feel inappropriate to life; wrong, not about this issue or that, but wrong as a person. To have average self-esteem is to fluctuate between feeling appropriate and inappropriate, right and wrong as a person; and to manifest these inconsistencies in behavior, sometimes acting wisely, sometimes acting foolishly—thereby reinforcing the uncertainty about who one is at one’s core.

Three basic observations: (1) If we respect ourselves, we tend to act in ways that confirm and reinforce this respect, such as requiring others to deal with us appropriately. (2) If we do not respect ourselves, we tend to act in ways that lower our sense of our own value even further, such as accepting or sanctioning inappropriate behavior toward us by others, thereby confirming and reinforcing our negativity. (3) If we wish to raise the level of our self-respect, we need to act in ways that will cause it to rise—and this begins with a commitment to the value of our own person, which is then expressed through congruent behavior.

Often at the beginning of therapy, I’ll ask patients to recount the past twenty-four hours in as much detail as possible. In this way I get a good sense of the current situation — their level of connectedness and sense of belonging, how their lives are peopled, what their responsibilities and stressors are, how peaceful or volatile their relationships might be, and how they choose to spend their time. It turns out that most of us aren’t aware of how we actually spend our time or what we really do all day until we break it down hour by hour and say it out loud.

Nothing is more common than to pursue self-esteem by means that will not and cannot work. Instead of seeking self-esteem through consciousness, responsibility, and integrity, we may seek it through popularity, material acquisitions, or sexual exploits. Instead of valuing personal authenticity, we may value belonging to the right clubs, or the right church, or the right political party. Instead of practicing appropriate self-assertion, we may practice uncritical compliance to our particular group. Instead of seeking self-respect through honesty, we may seek it through philanthropy—I must be a good person, I do “good works.”

Having worked for many years with persons who are unhappily preoccupied with the opinions of others, I am persuaded that the most effective means of liberation is by raising the level of consciousness one brings to one’s own experience: The more one turns up the volume on one’s inner signals, the more external signals tend to recede into proper balance. As I wrote in Honoring the Self, this entails learning to listen to the body, learning to listen to the emotions, learning to think for oneself.

their personal life is a monument to the magnitude of their unconsciousness concerning the internal world of the self. They deny and disown their needs, rationalize their emotions, intellectualize (or “spiritualize”) their behavior—while moving from one unsatisfactory relationship to another or remaining for a lifetime in the same one without doing anything practical to improve it. I am not living consciously if my consciousness is used for everything but self-understanding. Sometimes our efforts at self-examination hit an impasse for which we require the assistance of a guide, teacher, or psychotherapist. My focus here, again, is on an underlying intention, an orientation: a concern to know the inner world of needs, feelings, motives, mental processes. As contrasted with what? That condition of self-estrangement and self-alienation that to varying degrees is the state of most people (and about which I wrote in The Disowned Self). This intention or concern shows up in such simple questions as: Do I know what I am feeling at any particular moment? Do I recognize the impulses from which my actions spring? Do I notice if my feelings and actions are congruent? Do I know what needs or desires I may be trying to satisfy? Do I know what I actually want in a particular encounter with another person (not what I think I “should” want)? Do I know what my life is about? Is the “program” I am living one I accepted uncritically from others, or is it genuinely of my own choosing? Do

Note that this is entirely different from a morbid self-absorption that consists of taking one’s emotional temperature every ten minutes. I am not recommending obsessive self-preoccupation. I do not even like to talk about “introspection” in this context because it suggests something far more technical and remote from the average person’s experience. I prefer to talk about “the art of noticing.” Noticing the feelings in my body. Noticing my emotions during an encounter with someone. Noticing patterns in my behavior that may not be serving me. Noticing what excites me and what drains me. Noticing whether the voice inside my head is truly my own or belongs to someone else—perhaps my mother. To notice, I have to be interested. I have to think the practice worthwhile. I have to believe there is value in knowing myself. I may have to be willing to look at troublesome facts. I have to be convinced that, longterm, I have more to gain from consciousness than unconsciousness.

The ways we know what area of our life needs more awareness are usually fairly obvious. We look at the area where our life is working least satisfactorily. We notice where the pains and frustrations are. We observe where we feel least effective.

To be self-accepting is to be on my own side—to be for myself. In the most fundamental sense, self-acceptance refers to an orientation of self-value and self-commitment that derives from the fact that I am alive and conscious. As such, it is more primitive than self-esteem. It is a prerational, premoral act of self-affirmation—a kind of natural egoism that is the birthright of every human being and yet that we have the power to act against and nullify.

Suppose I have done something that I regret, or of which I am ashamed, and for which I reproach myself. Self-acceptance does not deny reality, does not argue that what is wrong is really all right, but it inquires into the context in which the action was taken. It wants to understand the why.

I can condemn some action I have taken and still have compassionate interest in the motives that prompted it. I can still be a friend to myself. This has nothing to do with alibiing, rationalizing, or avoiding responsibility. After I take responsibility for what I have done, I can go deeper—into the context.

The psychoanalyst Erich Fromm had made this point more than fifty years earlier: “Modern man thinks he loses something — time — when he does not do things quickly; yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains except kill it.” Fromm was right; people didn’t use extra time earned to relax or connect with friends or family. Instead, they tried to cram more in.

I do not support the grandiose notion that “I am responsible for every aspect of my existence and everything that befalls me.” Some things we have control over; others we do not. If I hold myself responsible for matters beyond my control, I put my self-esteem in jeopardy, since inevitably I will fail my expectations. If I deny responsibility for matters that are within my control, again I jeopardize my self-esteem. I need to know the difference between that which is up to me and that which is not. The only consciousness over which I have volitional control is my own.

Sometimes a therapist will deliberately “prescribe the problem” or symptom that the patient wants to resolve. A young man who keeps putting off finding a job might be told in therapy that he can’t look for a job; a woman who won’t initiate sex with her partner might be told not to initiate it for a month. This strategy, in which the therapist instructs patients not to do what they’re already not doing, is called a paradoxical intervention.

One of the great self-delusions is to think of oneself as “a valuer” or “an idealist” while not pursuing one’s values in reality. To dream one’s life away is not self-assertion; to be able to say, at the end, “While my life was happening, I was there, I lived it,” is.
